# Java Experiment Management System

## Description

This project is a Java-based system for managing laboratory experiments, likely for educational purposes. It includes both a backend developed with Java and a frontend built with Vue.js.

## Features

- User authentication (Student and Teacher roles)
- Experiment management (creation, viewing, etc.)
- Submission of experiment results
- Grading of submissions
- File upload/download capabilities

## Technologies Used

**Backend:**

- Java
- Spring Boot (Inferred from project structure)
- Maven (Inferred from pom.xml)
- Database (Needs specification, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

**Frontend:**

- Vue.js (Inferred from javahw-frontend directory)
- Element Plus (Inferred from attached file `WelcomeView.vue` using `el-button`)

## Setup and Installation

*(Instructions here will depend on specific dependencies, database setup, and configuration. Placeholder for now.)*

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the backend (database configuration, run Maven build).
3. Set up the frontend (install dependencies, configure API endpoints).

## Running the Application

*(Instructions here will depend on how the backend and frontend are started.)*

1. Start the backend server.
2. Start the frontend development server.
